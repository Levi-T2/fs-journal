# Daily Reflection
This is a stressful week! You are working on a project that closely mimics what you will be expected to accomplish during a standard 40 hour work week. Are you enjoying the struggles? Are you managing your time wisely? 

## Prompts
- How is today going? 
- Are you managing your stress?
- What has you most worried?

| Today went well I didn't have any major issues come up in my code that I couldn't figure out. I think that I'll have the project done by Wednesday. If I get done by then I'll start searching for jobs. |
