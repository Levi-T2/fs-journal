01. What is the difference between `asynchronous` code and `synchronous` code?

  > | All code thats normally written is synchronous, which means it runs line by line going down the page, and if something takes to long the task gets skipped over. With asynchronous code it can be invoked to run, and while its being run other pieces of code can be run as well. |

08. What must you do in order to `await` a promise inside of a function?
