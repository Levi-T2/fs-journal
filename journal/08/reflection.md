# Weekly Reflection
This reflection is open-format, so it can be whatever you like. Take this opportunity to write a bit on some of the things you have learned this week or some of the things that you are still struggling with; identify some challenges you had at the beginning of the week that you were able to overcome, or just generally reflect on how you are feeling at this point in the course.

## Prompts
- What went well this week?
- What did you learn that was a shock or surprise?
- What are you struggling with?
- What would you count as a victory?

| Still working on my capstone but its going well so far. Most of the stuff we have wanted to put into our application has worked so far. I learned more stuff about how to send objects back in get requests, which is something I wanted to learn. Overall, I think our capstone can get finished on time. |
