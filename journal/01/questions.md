# Foundations of Web Development
01. In your own words, why do we use Git?
    > | Best service available for developers to work with other members and being able to push and pull code so
    that everyone has the same project. |

02. In the terminal, what is the command `mkdir` used for?
    > | Used to make a folder/directory that you can use to store stuff in.|

03. What is a ***pseudo-class*** and what are some of the most common ones you think you will use?
    > | A pseudo-class is something that you add to the selector that tells it to do something to one of
    the elements selected within it. I think I'll end up using the different child pseudo-classes as they could help with targeting
    a specific element within the parent element.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Its the value that are assigned to selectors. CSS uses it to determine what properties to apply to your
    elements based on what specificity each of your selectors was set to. Even if a selector is placed above another, if the specificity of the other one is higher it will uses those properties.|

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?
    > | It would mess with the specificity and eventually it would be difficult to change certain values as 
    they would all have the same level of specificity that the important assigned to them. |

06. What are the three components that makeup a `CSS` rule? <br> Example:

    ```css
        h1 {
            color: rgba(255, 210, 33, .75);
        }
    ```
 
    > | The three css components are selector, which is the first thing you write in css and in this example is h1. The second is the property, or what your directly changing, which in this example is color. The third is value, which determines how much your changing a certain property, which in this case is our rgba value. |

07. How do you think good design influences people when visiting a website, and what sorts of things could you convey through design alone?
    > | Good design matters heavily when visiting a website as people like looking at pretty things; not only that a good designed webpage is easier to read and makes accessibility to your website better. You can convey your websites tone through design and whether its a website catering towards more commercial clients, or just basic users who are trying to visit your site. |

08. What is the purpose of ***wireframing***?
    > | We use wireframing to get a rough estimate of how we want to layout our webpage. By using wireframing, it can accelerate the process of us creating our page and can help with the transition from mobile to desktop as well. |

09. Do you think wireframes are worth the time, energy, and effort that they require? Why or Why not?
    > | I personally really like wireframing and I think it helps me with using bootstrap and setting up my webpage in a nice and organized matter. While it can take some time to do in the long run it speeds up the design process a lot in my opinion. |

10. Define the display `:flex property:`
    > | The flex property is an easy way to change the sizing, spacing, and centering of elements. There are a lot of different properties that effect them, and they are used pretty commonly in web development. |

11. What `CSS` properties affect the size of a box model?
    > | Properties like padding and margin effect the size of the box model by expanding the space around the content box. Changing properties in the content box as well such as font size and weight can change the size of the box as well. |
