    a specific element within the parent element.|

04. What is ***specificity*** and how might you use it to your benefit?
    > | Its the value that are assigned to selectors. CSS uses it to determine what properties to apply to your
    elements based on what specificity each of your selectors was set to. Even if a selector is placed above another, if the specificity of the other one is higher it will uses those properties.|

05. What problems do you think you could run into if you over-utilized the `!important` feature?

    they would all have the same level of specificity that the important assigned to them. |
