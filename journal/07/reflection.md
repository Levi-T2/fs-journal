> | I would say that this weeks checkpoint wasn't as challenging as others in just general difficulty with understanding how functions work, but was difficult in the sense that there was a lot of things that needed done and only so much time to do it. Time management and knowing how to use vue efficiently was super important. I still struggle with some of the more complex server side stuff with virtuals and populating them onto models and what functions do or don't need to be populated. Having written the back-end did make the client side services easier as I didn't need to read any document and knew exactly what the functions returned. Overall I'd say that this week was challenging but I didn't generally hate it. |
